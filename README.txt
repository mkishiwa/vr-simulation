VR Vestibular Conflict Simulation
===============================

HOW TO USE:
1. Open index.html in any browser (Chrome is best).
2. You'll see a moving tunnel — this simulates motion.
3. Your body is still, but your eyes see motion — this mismatch causes disorientation.
4. This is a demo of vestibular conflict in VR environments.

FILES:
- index.html: The main webpage.
- main.js: JavaScript that makes the tunnel move.
- three.min.js: Placeholder — please download from https://threejs.org/build/three.min.js
